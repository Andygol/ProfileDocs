<!--if cura_version <= 4.1:The prime tower jerk has a significant effect if the [square prime tower](../dual/prime_tower_circular.md) is used, because there are actually corners to take. With a round prime tower, the effect of this jerk setting is negligible since the corners in the prime tower are all very obtuse. There is not much of a direction change, so even a small amount of jerk allows the nozzle to continue at maximum speed.-->
