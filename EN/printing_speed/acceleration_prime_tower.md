Prime Tower Acceleration
====
### **Description**
This setting controls how fast the nozzle accelerates into different directions while printing the prime tower. 

### **Influence**
Increasing this setting allows the extrusion to be more constant, allowing for better priming. A higher acceleration rate for prime tower also reduces printing time. However, the prime tower may topple more easily if the acceleration rate gets very high and the printer vibrates a lot during its printing.

### **Usage**
The Prime Tower Acceleration can be set to a different rate than the rest of the print.
<!--if cura_version <= 4.1:The prime tower acceleration has a significant effect if the [square prime tower](../dual/prime_tower_circular.md) is used, because there are actually corners to take. With a round prime tower, the effect of this acceleration setting is negligible since all of the acceleration will be caught by the jerk setting.-->
