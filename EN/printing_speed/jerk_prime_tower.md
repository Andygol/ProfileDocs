Prime Tower Jerk
====
### **Description**
This setting determines the speed at which the nozzle can go through corners while printing the prime tower. 

### **Influence**
Reducing this setting reduces the vibrations going through the printer while printing the prime tower, which can prevent the prime tower from toppling over.

### **Usage**
This setting can be configured separately from the rest of the print.
<!--if cura_version <= 4.1:The prime tower jerk has a significant effect if the [square prime tower](../dual/prime_tower_circular.md) is used, because there are actually corners to take. With a round prime tower, the effect of this jerk setting is negligible since the corners in the prime tower are all very obtuse. There is not much of a direction change, so even a small amount of jerk allows the nozzle to continue at maximum speed.-->
